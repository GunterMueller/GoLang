For the installation of all packages of murus simply call "./gi".

>>> Important:

If your installed murus is older then v. 160121, then
prior to "tar xfzv murus.tgz" you have to delete your old
murus-directory to get rid of obsolete source code files,
that will cause errors while compiling the murus packages.
